Editing Temporary Tables
========================

Data Studio allows you to edit temporary tables. Temporary tables are deleted automatically when you close the connection that was used to create the table.

.. important::

   Ensure that connection reuse is enabled when you use the SQL Terminal to edit temporary tables. Refer to :ref:`Managing SQL Terminal Connections <dws_ds_130>` for information about enabling SQL Terminal Connection reuse.

Follow the steps to edit a temporary table:

#. Execute a query on the temporary table.

   The **Result** tab displays the results of the SQL query along with the query statement executed.

#. Edit the temporary table from the **Result** tab. Refer to the :ref:`Executing SQL Queries <en-us_topic_0000001145833051__en-us_topic_0185264856_section16147111413113>` for information on editing the resultset.
