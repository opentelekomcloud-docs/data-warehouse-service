Granting/Revoking Privileges
============================

The batch grant/revoke operation allows you select multiple objects to grant/revoke privileges. You can also perform batch grant/revoke operation on searched objects.

This feature is only available for OLAP, not for OLTP.

.. note::

   Batch grant/revoke is allowed only with the same object type within that schema.

Follow the steps to grant/revoke privileges in a batch:

#. Press **Ctrl+left-click** (select objects one by one) or **Shift+left-click** (select objects in a bunch) to select the objects to grant/revoke privileges.

#. Right-click and select **Grant/Revoke**.

   **Grant/Revoke** dialog box is displayed.

#. Refer to :ref:`Granting/Revoking a Privilege <dws_ds_54>` section to grant/revoke privilege.
