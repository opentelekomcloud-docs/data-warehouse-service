Overview
========

Data Studio shows major database features using a GUI to simplify database development and application building.

Data Studio allows database developers to create and manage database objects, such as databases, schemas, functions, stored procedures, tables, sequences, columns, indexes, constraints, and views, execute SQL statements or SQL scripts, edit and execute PL/SQL statements, as well as import and export table data.

Data Studio also allows database developers to debug and fix defects in the PL/SQL code using debugging operations such as **Step Into**, **Step Out**, **Step Over**, **Continue**, and **Terminate**.

The following figure shows the operating environment of the database and Data Studio.
