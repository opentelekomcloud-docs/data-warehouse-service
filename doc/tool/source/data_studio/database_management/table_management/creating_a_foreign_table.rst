Creating a Foreign Table
========================

.. important::

   Currently, Data Studio does not support foreign table creation. You can only view foreign tables.

Foreign tables created using query execution in **SQL Terminal** or any other tool can be viewed in the **Object** browser after refresh.

Right-click the database, schema, or foreign table group and choose **Refresh** from the shortcut menu to view the created foreign table.
