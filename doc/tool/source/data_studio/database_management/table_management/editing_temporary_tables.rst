Editing Temporary Tables
========================

Data Studio allows you to edit temporary tables. Temporary tables are deleted automatically when you close the connection that was used to create the table.

.. important::

   Ensure that connection reuse is enabled when you use edit temporary tables in **SQL Terminal**. For details, see :ref:`Managing Connections in the SQL Terminal <dws_ds_037>`.

Follow the steps to edit a temporary table:

#. Execute a query on the temporary table.

   The **Result** tab displays the results of the SQL query along with the query statement executed.

#. Edit the temporary table on the **Result** tab. You can click to add, delete, modify, or cancel modifications to edit the temporary table.
