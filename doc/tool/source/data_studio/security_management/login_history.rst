Login History
=============

The following information is critical to the security management for Data Studio:

-  When you log into a database, Data Studio displays a pop-up with details of the last successful login and failure attempts between the last two successful logins for you on the logged database.

.. note::

   If the pop-up displays the message "Last login details not available", then it implies that the connected database does not support the last login display feature.
