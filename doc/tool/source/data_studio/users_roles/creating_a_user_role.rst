Creating a User/Role
====================

A database is used by many users, and the users are grouped for management convenience. A database role can be one or a group of database users.

Users and roles have similar concepts in databases. In practice, you are advised to use a role to manage permissions rather than to access databases.

**Users** - They are set of database users. These users are different from operating system users. These users can assign privileges to other users to access database objects.

**Role** - This can be considered as a user or group based on the usage. Roles are at cluster level, and hence applicable to all databases in the cluster.
