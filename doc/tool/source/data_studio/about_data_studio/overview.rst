Overview
========

Data Studio provides a graphical interface which supports essential features of the database. This simplifies database development and application building tasks.

Data Studio allows the database developer to manage and create database objects (database, schema, functions, procedures, tables, sequences, columns, indexes, constraints, views, and tablespaces), execute SQL statements or SQL scripts, edit and execute PL/SQL statements, as well as import and export table data.

Data Studio also allows the database developer to debug and fix defects in the PL/SQL code using debugging operations such as **Step Into**, **Step Out**, **Step Over**, **Continue**, and **Terminate**.

The following figure provides the operational context of database and Data Studio.
