Dropping a Table
================

Individual or batch dropping can be performed on tables. Refer to :ref:`Dropping a Batch of Objects <dws_ds_133>` section for batch dropping.

This operation removes the complete table structure (including the table definition and index information) from the database and you have to re-create this table once again to store data.

Follow the steps below to drop the table:

#. Right-click the selected table and select **Drop Table**.

   Data Studio prompts you to confirm this operation.

#. In the confirmation dialog box, click **OK** to complete the operation successfully.

   The status bar displays the status of the completed operation.
