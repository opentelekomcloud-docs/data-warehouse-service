Disconnecting All Databases
===========================

You can disconnect all the databases from a connection.

Follow the steps below to disconnect all the databases from a connection:

#. In the **Object Browser** pane, right-click the selected the **Databases** group and select **Disconnect All**. This will disconnect all the databases under that connection.

   .. note::

      This operation can be performed only when there is at least one active database.

   A confirmation dialog box is displayed to disconnect all databases for the connection.

#. Click **Yes** to disconnect.

   The status bar displays the status of the completed operation.

   Data Studio populates all the connection parameters (except password) that were provided during the last successful connection with the database. To reconnect, you need to enter only the password in the connection wizard.
