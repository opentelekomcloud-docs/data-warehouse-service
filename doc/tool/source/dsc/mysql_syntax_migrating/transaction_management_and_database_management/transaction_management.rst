TRANSACTION
-----------

DSC will perform adaptation based on GaussDB(DWS) features during MySQL transaction statement migration.

**Input**

::

   ## Each statement applies only to the next single transaction performed within the session.
   SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
   SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
   SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;
   SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
   SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY;
   SET TRANSACTION READ WRITE;
   SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED,READ ONLY;
   SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE,READ WRITE;
   ## Each statement (with the SESSION keyword) applies to all subsequent transactions performed within the current session.
   START TRANSACTION;
   SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
   SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
   SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
   SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
   commit ;

**Output**

::

   -- Each statement applies only to the next single transaction performed within the session.
   SET LOCAL TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
   SET LOCAL TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
   SET LOCAL TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;
   SET LOCAL TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
   SET LOCAL TRANSACTION READ ONLY;
   SET LOCAL TRANSACTION READ WRITE;
   SET LOCAL TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED READ ONLY;
   SET LOCAL TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE READ WRITE;
   -- Each statement (with the SESSIONkeyword) applies to all subsequent transactions performed within the current session.
   START TRANSACTION;
   SET SESSION CHARACTERISTICS AS TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
   SET SESSION CHARACTERISTICS AS TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
   SET SESSION CHARACTERISTICS AS TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
   SET SESSION CHARACTERISTICS AS TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
   COMMIT WORK;

LOCK
----

DSC will perform adaptation based on GaussDB(DWS) features during the migration of MySQL table locking statements which are used in transaction processing.

**Input**

::

   ## A.
   START TRANSACTION;
   LOCK TABLES `mt`.`runoob_tbl` WRITE,`mt`.`runoob_tb2` READ;
   commit;

   ## B.
   START TRANSACTION;
   LOCK TABLES `mt`.`runoob_tbl` WRITE;
   commit;

   ## C.
   START TRANSACTION;
   LOCK TABLES `mt`.`runoob_tbl` READ,`mt`.`runoob_tbl` AS t1 READ;
   commit;

**Output**

::

   -- A.
   START TRANSACTION;
   LOCK TABLE "mt"."runoob_tbl" IN ACCESS EXCLUSIVE MODE;
   LOCK TABLE "mt"."runoob_tb2" IN ACCESS SHARE MODE;
   COMMIT WORK;

   -- B.
   START TRANSACTION;
   LOCK TABLE "mt"."runoob_tbl" IN ACCESS EXCLUSIVE MODE;
   COMMIT WORK;

   -- C.
   START TRANSACTION;
   LOCK TABLE "mt"."runoob_tbl" IN ACCESS SHARE MODE;
   COMMIT WORK;
