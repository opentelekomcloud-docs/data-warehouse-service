Schema Objects
==============

This section describes the syntax for migrating Teradata schema objects. The migration syntax determines how the keywords and features are migrated.

The schema refers to the data structure of a database. DSC facilitates schema migration from Teradata to GaussDB(DWS).

This section includes the following sub-chapters:

Table Migration, Index Migration, View Migration, COLLECT STATISTICS, ACCESS LOCK, DBC.COLUMNS, DBC.TABLES, DBC.INDICES, and SHOW STATS VALUES SEQUENCED. For details, see :ref:`Table Migration <dws_mt_0048>` to :ref:`SHOW STATS VALUES SEQUENCED <dws_07_8111>`.
