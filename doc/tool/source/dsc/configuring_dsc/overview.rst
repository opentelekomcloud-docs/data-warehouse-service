Overview
========

DSC provides configuration files and parameters to configure migration logic and rules. Before migrating scripts, you need to configure the following as required:

#. Tool configuration before migration: Configure DSC after its installation. For details, see :ref:`DSC Configuration <dws_mt_0025>`.
#. Rule configuration before migration: Configure migration rules by modifying configuration files for :ref:`Teradata SQL <dws_mt_0026>`, :ref:`Oracle SQL <dws_mt_0027>`, :ref:`Teradata Perl <dws_mt_0029>`, or :ref:`MySQL SQL <dws_07_0666>`.
#. Custom configuration after migration: :ref:`Customize rules <dws_mt_0030>` in the destination database to migrate the input keywords that are not supported by the destination database.
