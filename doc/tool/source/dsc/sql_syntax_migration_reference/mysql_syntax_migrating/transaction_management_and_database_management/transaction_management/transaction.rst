TRANSACTION
===========

DSC will perform adaptation based on GaussDB features during MySQL transaction statement migration.

**Input**

.. code-block::

   ## Each statement applies only to the next single transaction performed within the session.
   SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
   SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
   SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;
   SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
   SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY;
   SET TRANSACTION READ WRITE;
   SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED,READ ONLY;
   SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE,READ WRITE;
   ## Each statement (with the SESSION keyword) applies to all subsequent transactions performed within the current session.
   START TRANSACTION;
   SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
   SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
   SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
   SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
   commit ;

**Output**

.. code-block::

   -- Each statement applies only to the next single transaction performed within the session.
   SET LOCAL TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
   SET LOCAL TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
   SET LOCAL TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;
   SET LOCAL TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
   SET LOCAL TRANSACTION READ ONLY;
   SET LOCAL TRANSACTION READ WRITE;
   SET LOCAL TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED READ ONLY;
   SET LOCAL TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE READ WRITE;
   -- Each statement (with the SESSIONkeyword) applies to all subsequent transactions performed within the current session.
   START TRANSACTION;
   SET SESSION CHARACTERISTICS AS TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
   SET SESSION CHARACTERISTICS AS TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
   SET SESSION CHARACTERISTICS AS TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
   SET SESSION CHARACTERISTICS AS TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
   COMMIT WORK;
