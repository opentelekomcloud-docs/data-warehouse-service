SHOW STATS VALUES SEQUENCED
===========================

This command displays the COLLECT STATISTICS statement with statistics. Gauss does not have an equivalent for this. Since it does not affect the functionality, this command can be commented.

**Input**

.. code-block::

   SHOW STATS VALUES SEQUENCED on "temp"."table"

**Output**

.. code-block::

   /*SHOW STATS VALUES SEQUENCED on "temp"."table"*/
