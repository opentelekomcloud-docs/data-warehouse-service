PURGE
=====

In Oracle, the **DROP TABLE** statement moves a table to the recycle bin. The **PURGE** statement is used to remove a table or index from the recycle bin and release all of the space associated with the object. This statement also removes the entire recycle bin, or part or all of a dropped tablespace from the recycle bin. The migrated query does not contain **PURGE**.
