GLOBAL_REL_IOSTAT
=================

**GLOBAL_REL_IOSTAT** displays the total disk I/O statistics of all nodes in a cluster. The name of each column in this view is the same as that in the :ref:`GS_REL_IOSTAT <dws_04_0691>` view, but the column meaning is the sum of the value of the same column in the **GS_REL_IOSTAT** view on each node. This view is accessible only to users with system administrator rights.
