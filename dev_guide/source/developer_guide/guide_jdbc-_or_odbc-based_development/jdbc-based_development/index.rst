JDBC-Based Development
======================

Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is a Java API for executing SQL statements, providing a unified access interface for different relational databases, based on which applications process data. GaussDB(DWS) supports JDBC 4.0 and requires JDK 1.6 or later for code compiling. It does not support JDBC-ODBC Bridge.
