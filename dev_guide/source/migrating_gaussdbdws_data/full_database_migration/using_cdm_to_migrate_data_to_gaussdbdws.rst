Using CDM to Migrate Data to GaussDB(DWS)
=========================================

You can use CDM to migrate data from other data sources (for example, MySQL) to the databases in clusters on GaussDB(DWS).

CDM can migrate various types of data in batches between homogeneous and heterogeneous data sources.

.. note::

   CDM migrates data to GaussDB(DWS) using the copy method or the GDS parallel import method.

To learn more about how CDM is used to migrate data to GaussDB(DWS), see "DataArts Migration" in the *DataArts Studio User Guide*.
