Introduction
============

Generalized Inverted Index (GIN) is designed for handling cases where the items to be indexed are composite values, and the queries to be handled by the index need to search for element values in the composite items. For example, the items could be documents, and the queries could be searches for documents containing specific words.

We use the word "item" to refer to a composite value that is to be indexed, and the word "key" to refer to an element value. GIN stores and searches for keys, not item values.

A GIN index stores a set of (key, posting list) key-value pairs, where a posting list is a set of row IDs in which the key occurs. The same row ID can appear in multiple posting lists, since an item can contain more than one key. Each key value is stored only once, so a GIN index is very compact for cases where the same key appears many times.

GIN is generalized in the sense that the GIN access method code does not need to know the specific operations that it accelerates. Instead, it uses custom strategies defined for particular data types. The strategy defines how keys are extracted from indexed items and query conditions, and how to determine whether a row that contains some of the key values in a query actually satisfies the query.
