UUID Functions
==============

UUID functions are used to generate UUID data (see :ref:`UUID Type <dws_06_0019>`).

-  uuid_generate_v1()

   Description: Generates a UUID sequence number.

   Return type: UUID

   Example:

   ::

      SELECT uuid_generate_v1();
                 uuid_generate_v1
      --------------------------------------
       c71ceaca-a175-11e9-a920-797ff7000001
      (1 row)

   .. note::

      The uuid_generate_v1 function generates UUIDs based on the time information, cluster node ID, and thread ID that generates the sequence. Each UUID is globally unique in a cluster, but there is a low probability that a UUID is duplicated among multiple clusters.

-  sys_guid()

   Description: Generate a sequence number that is the same as the sequence number generated by the Oracle sys_guid method.

   Return type: text

   Example:

   ::

      SELECT sys_guid();
                   sys_guid
      ----------------------------------
       4EBD3C74A17A11E9A1BF797FF7000001
      (1 row)

   .. note::

      The data generation principle of the sys_guid function is the same as that of the uuid_generate_v1 function.
