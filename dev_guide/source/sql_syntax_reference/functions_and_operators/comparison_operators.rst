Comparison Operators
====================

Comparison operators can be used for all data types. The return results are Boolean values.

All comparison operators are binary operators. Only data types that are the same or can be implicitly converted can be compared using comparison operators. Expressions such as "1<2<3" are invalid because Boolean values cannot be compared with 3.
