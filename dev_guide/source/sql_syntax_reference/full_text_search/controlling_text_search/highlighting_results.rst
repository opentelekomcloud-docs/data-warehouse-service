Highlighting Results
====================

To present search results it is ideal to show a part of each document and how it is related to the query. Usually, search engines show fragments of the document with marked search terms. GaussDB(DWS) provides function **ts_headline** that implements this functionality.

::

   ts_headline([ config regconfig, ] document text, query tsquery [, options text ]) returns text

**ts_headline** accepts a document along with a query, and returns an excerpt from the document in which terms from the query are highlighted. The configuration to be used to parse the document can be specified by **config**. If **config** is omitted, the **default_text_search_config** configuration is used.

If an options string is specified it must consist of a comma-separated list of one or more **option=value** pairs. The available options are:

-  **StartSel**, **StopSel**: The strings with which to delimit query words appearing in the document, to distinguish them from other excerpted words. You must double-quote these strings if they contain spaces or commas.
-  **MaxWords**, **MinWords**: These numbers determine the longest and shortest headlines to output.

-  **ShortWord**: Words of this length or less will be dropped at the start and end of a headline. The default value of three eliminates common English articles.

-  **HighlightAll**: Boolean flag. If the value is **true**, the entire document is used as an excerpt, ignoring the values of the first three parameters.

-  **MaxFragments**: Maximum number of text excerpts or fragments to display. The default value of zero selects a non-fragment-oriented headline generation method. A value greater than zero selects fragment-based headline generation. This method finds text fragments with as many query words as possible and stretches those fragments around the query words. As a result query words are close to the middle of each fragment and have words on each side. Each fragment will be of at most **MaxWords** and words of length **ShortWord** or less are dropped at the start and end of each fragment. If not all query words are found in the document, then a single fragment of the first **MinWords** in the document will be displayed.

-  **FragmentDelimiter**: When more than one fragment is displayed, the fragments will be separated by this string.

Any unspecified options receive these defaults:

::

   StartSel=<b>, StopSel=</b>,
   MaxWords=35, MinWords=15, ShortWord=3, HighlightAll=FALSE,
   MaxFragments=0, FragmentDelimiter=" ... "

For example:

::

   SELECT ts_headline('english','The most common type of search is to find all documents containing given query terms and return them in order of their similarity to the query.',to_tsquery('english', 'query & similarity'));
                                                    ts_headline
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    containing given <b>query</b> terms and return them in order of their <b>similarity</b> to the <b>query</b>.
   (1 row)

   SELECT ts_headline('english','The most common type of search is to find all documents containing given query terms and return them in order of their similarity to the query.',to_tsquery('english', 'query & similarity'),'StartSel = <, StopSel = >');
                                             ts_headline
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    containing given <query> terms and return them in order of their <similarity> to the <query>.
   (1 row)

**ts_headline** uses the original document, not a **tsvector** summary, so it can be slow and should be used with care.
