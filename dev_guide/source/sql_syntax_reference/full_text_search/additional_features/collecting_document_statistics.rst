Collecting Document Statistics
==============================

The function **ts_stat** is useful for checking your configuration and for finding stop-word candidates.

::

   ts_stat(sqlquery text, [ weights text, ]
           OUT word text, OUT ndoc integer,
           OUT nentry integer) returns setof record

**sqlquery** is a text value containing an SQL query which must return a single **tsvector** column. **ts_stat** executes the query and returns statistics about each distinct lexeme (word) contained in the **tsvector** data. The columns returned are

-  **word text**: the value of a lexeme
-  **ndoc integer**: number of documents (**tsvector**\ s) the word occurred in
-  **nentry integer**: total number of occurrences of the word

If **weights** are supplied, only occurrences having one of those weights are counted. For example, to find the ten most frequent words in a document collection:

::

   SELECT * FROM ts_stat('SELECT to_tsvector(''english'', sr_reason_sk) FROM tpcds.store_returns WHERE sr_customer_sk < 10') ORDER BY nentry DESC, ndoc DESC, word LIMIT 10;
      word | ndoc | nentry
   ------+------+--------
    32   |    2 |      2
    33   |    2 |      2
    1    |    1 |      1
    10   |    1 |      1
    13   |    1 |      1
    14   |    1 |      1
    15   |    1 |      1
    17   |    1 |      1
    20   |    1 |      1
    22   |    1 |      1
   (10 rows)

The same, but counting only word occurrences with weight **A** or **B**:

::

   SELECT * FROM ts_stat('SELECT to_tsvector(''english'', sr_reason_sk) FROM tpcds.store_returns WHERE sr_customer_sk < 10', 'a') ORDER BY nentry DESC, ndoc DESC, word LIMIT 10;
    word | ndoc | nentry
   ------+------+--------
   (0 rows)
