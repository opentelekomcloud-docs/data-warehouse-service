PGXC_OS_RUN_INFO
================

**PGXC_OS_RUN_INFO** displays the OS running status of each node in the cluster. All columns except **node_name** are the same as those in the :ref:`PV_OS_RUN_INFO <dws_04_0850>` view. Only the system administrator or the preset role **gs_role_read_all_stats** can access this view.
