==============

**PGXC_REDO_STAT** displays statistics on redoing Xlogs of each node in the cluster. All columns except **node_name** are the same as those in the :ref:`PV_REDO_STAT <dws_04_0856>` view. Only the system administrator or the preset role **gs_role_read_all_stats** can access this view.
