PGXC_INSTANCE_TIME
==================

**PGXC_INSTANCE_TIME** displays the running time of processes on each node in the cluster and the time consumed in each execution phase. Except the **node_name** column, the other columns are the same as those in the :ref:`PV_INSTANCE_TIME <dws_04_0849>` view. Only the system administrator or the preset role **gs_role_read_all_stats** can access this view.
