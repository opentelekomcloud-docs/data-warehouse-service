===============

**PGXC_TABLE_STAT** provides statistics of all tables of the database on all CNs and DNs in the cluster. Except the **nodename** column of the name type added in front of each row, the names, types, and sequences of other columns are the same as those in the **GS_TABLE_STAT** view. For details about the columns, see :ref:`GS_TABLE_STAT <dws_04_0953>`.
