Creating an IAM User Credential
===============================

You can log in to the management console to create an AK/SK pair or use an existing one.

Creating an AK/SK Pair
----------------------

Log in to the management console, move your cursor over your account in the upper right corner, and choose **My Credential**. Click the **Access Keys** tab. On the **Access Keys** tab page, you can view the existing AKs or click **Add Access Key** to create an AK/SK pair.

The AK/SK pair is so important that you can download the private key file containing the AK/SK information only when you create the pair. On the management console, you can only view the AKs. If you have not downloaded the file, create an AK/SK pair again.

.. note::

   Each user can create a maximum of two AK/SK pairs, which are valid permanently. To ensure account security, change your AK/SK pairs periodically and keep them safe.
