Workload Analysis Overview
==========================

The workload analysis tool of GaussDB(DWS) collects and analyzes database performance data. You can create workload snapshots to record cluster workload data in a specified period. A workload diagnosis report can be generated based on two workload information snapshots within a certain time segment. Workload Diagnosis Report (WDR) provides performance data in a specified period and presents the data on HTML web pages. It helps you detect exceptions, diagnose problems, and optimize performance. It is a powerful tool for database performance tuning.

.. note::

   -  The WDR function is available only in 8.1.1.300 and later cluster versions.
   -  Workload diagnosis reports can be stored only in OBS.
