Viewing Events
==============

This section describes how to search for events that occur in a cluster or snapshot.

#. Log in to the GaussDB(DWS) console.

#. In the navigation tree on the left, choose **Management** > **Events**.

   On the **Events** tab page, all events that occur in the clusters or snapshots are displayed by default.

   You can sort the events in descending or ascending order by clicking |image1| next to **Time**.

   You can search for events by time, event, event level, event source, event source type, or event type using the search box at the top of the event list.
