Database Monitoring Overview
============================

Overview
--------

DMS is provided by GaussDB(DWS) to ensure the fast and stable running of databases. It collects, monitors, and analyzes the disk, network, and OS metric data used by the service database, as well as key performance metric data of cluster running. It also diagnoses database hosts, instances, and service SQL statements based on the collected metrics to expose key faults and performance problems in a database in a timely manner, and guides customers to optimize and resolve the problems.

.. note::

   The database monitoring function is supported by 8.1.1.200 and later versions.
