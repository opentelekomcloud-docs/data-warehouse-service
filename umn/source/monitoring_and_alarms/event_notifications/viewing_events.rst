Viewing Events
==============

This section describes how to search for events that occur in a cluster or snapshot.

#. Log in to the GaussDB(DWS) management console.

#. In the navigation tree on the left, click **Events**.

   On the **Events** tab page, all events that occur in the clusters or snapshots are displayed by default.

   You can sort the events in descending or ascending order by clicking |image1| next to **Time**.

   You can filter the events by clicking |image2| next to a field (except **Time**) and selecting the criteria.
