Audit Log Overview
==================

GaussDB(DWS) provides database audit logs for users to query service logs, analyze problems, and learn product security and performance status.

Database Audit Logs
-------------------

If the **Security** function is enabled, GaussDB(DWS) records any DML and DDL operations performed by the database. You can locate and analyze faults based on the database audit logs, and perform behavior analysis and security auditing on historical database operations to improve GaussDB (DWS) security.

For details about how to enable and view database audit logs, see :ref:`Configuring the Database Audit Logs <dws_01_0075>` and :ref:`Viewing Database Audit Logs <dws_01_0183>`.
