What Is the Ruby User in the GaussDB(DWS) Database?
===================================================

When you run the **SELECT \* FROM pg_user** statement to view users in the current system, you may see user **Ruby** many times, who has many permissions.

User **Ruby** is an official O&M account. After a GaussDB(DWS) database is created, user **Ruby** is generated by default. There is no security risk in regard to user **Ruby**.
