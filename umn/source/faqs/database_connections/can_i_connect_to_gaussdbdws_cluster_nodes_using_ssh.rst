Can I Connect to GaussDB(DWS) Cluster Nodes Using SSH?
======================================================

No, direct access is not supported. VMs at the bottom layer of GaussDB(DWS) serve as the compute nodes for data analysis. Access cluster databases using the private or public network access address instead.
