Can I Connect to GaussDB(DWS) Cluster Nodes Using SSH?
======================================================

No, you can't, VMs at the bottom layer of GaussDB(DWS) serve as the compute nodes for data analysis. However, the GaussDB(DWS) compute nodes cannot be accessed directly. You can only access cluster databases using the private or public network access address.
