How Do I Do If I Cannot Connect to a GaussDB(DWS) Cluster?
==========================================================

Possible Causes
---------------

Check the following:

-  Whether the cluster status is normal.
-  Whether the connection command, username, password, IP address, and port number are incorrect.
-  Whether the operating system type and version of the client are correct.
-  Whether the client is incorrectly installed.

If cluster connection failed on the public cloud, check for the following as well:

-  The ECSs are not in the same AZ, VPC, subnet, and security group as the cluster.
-  Some of the inbound and outbound rules of the security group are incorrect.

If cluster connection failed through the Internet, confirm the following:

-  Whether your network is connected to the Internet.
-  Whether the firewall blocked the access.
-  Whether you need to access the Internet through a proxy.
