What Should I Do If I Cannot Connect to a Data Warehouse Cluster?
=================================================================

Troubleshooting
---------------

Check:

-  Whether the cluster status is normal.
-  Whether the connection command, username, password, IP address, and port are correct.
-  Whether the operating system type and version of the client are correct.
-  Whether the client is properly installed.

If cluster connection failed on the public cloud, check the following items:

-  Whether the ECSs are in the same AZ, VPC, subnet, and security group as the cluster.
-  Whether the inbound and outbound rules of the security group are correct.

If cluster connection failed through the Internet, confirm the following items:

-  Whether your network is connected to the Internet.
-  Whether the firewall blocked access.
-  Whether you need to access the Internet through a proxy.
