How Can I View SQL Execution Records in a Certain Period When Read and Write Requests Are Blocked?
==================================================================================================

You can use the top SQL feature to view SQL statements executed in a specified period. SQL statements of the current CN or all CNs can be viewed.

Top SQL allows you to view real-time and historical SQL statements.
