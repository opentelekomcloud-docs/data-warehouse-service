What Do I Do If My Cluster Is Unavailable Because of Insufficient Space?
========================================================================

You can use a snapshot to restore your cluster to a new one that has larger storage space, and then delete the old cluster. You can learn cluster storage by checking **Available Storage**. To restore your cluster to a new one, see "Restoring a Snapshot to a New Cluster" in *Data Warehouse Service (DWS) User Guide* To delete a cluster, see "Deleting a Cluster" in *Data Warehouse Service (DWS) User Guide*.
