Can I Modify the Security Group of a GaussDB(DWS) Cluster?
==========================================================

After a GaussDB(DWS) cluster is created, you can add, delete, or modify security group rules in the current security group.

-  Modifying an existing security group rule:

   #. Log in to the GaussDB(DWS) management console.
   #. In the navigation tree on the left, choose **Clusters** > **Dedicated Clusters**.
   #. In the cluster list, find the target cluster and click the cluster name. The **Basic Information** page is displayed.
   #. Locate the **Security Group** parameter and click the security group name to switch to the **Security Groups** page on the VPC console, on which you can set the security group.
