Can I Modify the Security Group of a GaussDB(DWS) Cluster?
==========================================================

Yes. When a data warehouse cluster is created, its security group cannot be changed. However, you can add, delete, or modify rules of the current security group.

To edit the cluster security group:

#. Log in to the GaussDB(DWS) management console.
#. In the navigation pane on the left, click **Clusters**.
#. In the cluster list, find the target cluster and click the cluster name. The **Basic Information** page is displayed.
#. Locate the **Security Group** parameter and click the security group name to switch to the **Security Groups** page on the VPC console, on which you can set the security group.
