How Is GaussDB(DWS) Secured?
============================

GaussDB(DWS) uses IAM and VPC to control user access and isolate cluster network. Cluster access is over SSL and cipher suite. Additionally, GaussDB(DWS) supports two-way digital certificate authentication.

Node OSs in each cluster are hardened to allow valid access to only OS files.
