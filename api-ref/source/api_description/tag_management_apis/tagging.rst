Tagging
=======

A tag is a key-value pair customized by users and used to classify and search for cloud resources.

A tag consists of a tag key and a tag value.

-  A tag key can contain multiple tag values.
-  A cloud resource cannot have duplicate tag keys.

On GaussDB(DWS), only cluster resources support the tag function.
