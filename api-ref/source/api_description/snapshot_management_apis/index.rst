Snapshot Management APIs
========================

A GaussDB(DWS) snapshot is a complete backup of a cluster. Snapshots are stored in the storage space of Object Storage Service (OBS). A snapshot can be used to restore a cluster to a newly created one that has the same flavor. Currently, you can only restore a cluster to a new one.
