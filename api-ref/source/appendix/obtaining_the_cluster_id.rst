Obtaining the Cluster ID
========================

A cluster ID (**cluster_id**) is required for some URLs when an API is called. To obtain a cluster ID, perform the following operations:

#. Log in to the GaussDB(DWS) console.

#. In the navigation pane on the left, click **Clusters**.

#. In the cluster list, find the target cluster and click the cluster name. The **Basic Information** page is displayed.

#. View the cluster ID.
